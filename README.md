# css-practice-website
This is where I practice and test css/flexbox designs. Hosted with github pages.

This is from The Odin Projects 'landing page' project. However, I intend to use this for
    future 'proof of concept' stylings I want to try.
    
Currently, I do not know how to style websites for mobile devices, when I learn to do so, I will update this site accordingly
